# Generated Terraform module

This Terraform module was generated by IBM Cloud Terraform template builder as part of an IBM Cloud Schematics workspace. The configuration files contain the resources and modules that were selected and configured in Terraform template builder. These configuration files can be modified directly, but they cannot be edited in Terraform template builder.

# Toolchain integration

An IBM Cloud DevOps toolchain was created by Terraform template builder and associated with this code repository. This toolchain provides a pipeline that can apply your Terraform configuration when the configuration files are changed. When pull requests are opened, the toolchain also runs Code Risk Analyzer to scan your Terraform configuration files for vulnerabilities.

You can find a link to the toolchain in the Settings page of your Schematics workspace. Alternatively, visit the [IBM Cloud DevOps page](https://cloud.ibm.com/devops/getting-started) in the IBM Cloud console, and navigate to the [Toolchains page](https://cloud.ibm.com/devops/toolchains). You can find the toolchain by using the toolchain name that you entered in Terraform template builder.
